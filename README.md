I'm a computer science student currently supposed to be working on a game. It's going.. it's not really going, actually.
I'm interested in a lot of things, recently I learned about Rust and have been looking at a lot of info about it.
I'm comfortable using C++, I started with Python but since moving on it's boring to write with.
